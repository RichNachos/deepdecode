cassette exons

if more than one transcript - find cassette exons
for every gene, get exon boundaries
    if only on transcript -
        if exon start coincides with gene start, discard the exon
        if exon end coincides with gene end, discard the exon
    if many transcripts, choose transcript with longest exon
